    <!-- 
        Purpose: Defines the character encoding for the HTML document.
        Why it matters: UTF-8 is a universal encoding that supports almost all characters from every language. Without this, characters like é, ü, or emojis might not display correctly.
        Example issue if missing: “Café” could appear as CafÃ©.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <!--
        Purpose: Ensures that Internet Explorer uses the latest rendering engine available (Edge mode) instead of older compatibility modes.
        Why it matters: Older versions of IE could render your page incorrectly if they defaulted to older standards.
        Effect: Keeps IE from using legacy quirks mode. Modern browsers ignore this meta tag.
    -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 

    <!--
        Purpose: Controls how your webpage is displayed on mobile devices.
        Breakdown of attributes:
        - width=device-width: Makes the viewport width equal to the device screen width.
        - initial-scale=1.0: Sets the initial zoom level to 100%.
        Why it matters: Without this, mobile browsers may zoom out your page, making it tiny and unreadable. This is essential for responsive design.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!--
        Purpose: Sets the title of the web page.
        Where it appears: In the browser tab, bookmarks, and search engine results.
        Why it matters: Helps users identify your page and improves SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
    -->
    <title>Store Catalog</title>
    

    <!--
    Purpose: Links an external CSS file to your HTML.
    Attributes:
    - rel="stylesheet" → tells the browser this is a stylesheet.
    - href="styles.css" → path to your CSS file.
    Why it matters: Without it, your HTML will appear unstyled, just plain text.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="store-catalog-styles.css">
    
    <!--
    Purpose: Includes an external JavaScript file (script.js) in your page.
    
    Differences between default script, async, and defer:
    - Default: Blocks HTML parsing until the script is downloaded and executed.
    - async (Independent scripts): Downloads the script while the HTML is parsing, but executes it as soon as it's ready, potentially before parsing is complete.
        Good for independent scripts like analytics, ads, or tracking code.
        Executes as soon as it’s loaded, order is not guaranteed.
    - defer (DOM-dependent scripts): Downloads the script while parsing, but waits to execute it until after the HTML is fully parsed.
        Recommended for most scripts that manipulate the DOM or depend on other scripts.
        Maintains the order of multiple scripts (important if one depends on another).

    type="module": Indicates that the script is a JavaScript module, allowing the use of import/export statements.
    If a file uses import or export, it must be declared as a module.
    -->
    <script defer type="module" src="store-catalog-script.js"></script>
    
    <!--
    Purpose: Provides a brief summary of the webpage's content.
    Why it matters: Search engines use this description in search results, which can influence click-through rates.
    Example: A well-written description can attract more visitors to your site.
    -->
    <meta name="description" content="Browse our store catalog for amazing products and deals.">
    
    <!--
    Purpose: Lists relevant keywords for the webpage.
    Why it matters: Although less influential than before, some search engines still consider keywords for indexing.
    Example: Including relevant keywords can help improve your page's visibility in search results.
    -->
    <meta name="keywords" content="store, catalog, products, shopping">
    
    <!--
    Purpose: Imports the Roboto font from Google Fonts.
    Why it matters: Using web fonts can enhance the visual appeal of your website and ensure consistent typography across different devices and browsers.
    Example: Without this link, the specified font may not load, and the browser will fall back to a default font.
    Note: Browser starts fetching the font immediately while parsing the HTML.
    Often slightly faster because it loads in parallel with other resources.
    Useful if multiple CSS files will use the font—you only need to load it once.
    -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
